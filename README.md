This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to the handling of zero values in a division operation. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  The issue arises from the naive check for zero values, leading to incorrect results. The solution emphasizes the importance of robust handling of potential division by zero errors.
